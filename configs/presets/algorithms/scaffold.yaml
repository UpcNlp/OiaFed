# Paper: SCAFFOLD: Stochastic Controlled Averaging for Federated Learning
# Authors: Karimireddy et al., 2020
#
# Description:
#   SCAFFOLD uses control variates to correct for client drift in federated
#   learning. It maintains both global and local control variates to reduce
#   variance in local updates and improve convergence in non-IID settings.
#
# Key Features:
#   - Control variates to correct client drift
#   - Improved convergence in heterogeneous settings
#   - Reduces communication rounds needed
#
# Components:
#   - Trainer: default
#   - Learner: fl.generic
#   - Aggregator: scaffold (with control variates)
#
# Usage:
#   extend: presets/algorithms/scaffold.yaml
